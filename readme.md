# Cozy Examples

Example games for the Cozy engine.

https://cozyengine.com/

To run these games, you will have to get the Cozy engine (see https://github.com/speveril/cozy) and then clone this repo. Then, in the Cozy engine, click the + button in the tool bar ("Add a Game Library") and use the file browser to choose the directory where you cloned this repo. It should detect all of the example games, and give you UI to run them.

Enjoy!

**Note that the Cozy Engine and its example games are effectively in a pre-alpha state right now. They may or may as well as we'd like.**
